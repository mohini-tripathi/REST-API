REST or RESTful stands for Representational State Transfer. It is an architectural style as well as an approach for communications purposes that is often used in various web services development. In simpler terms, it is an application program interface (API) that makes use of the HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE the data over the site.
Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services. Web services that conform to the REST architectural style, called RESTful Web services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. RESTful Web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations. Other kinds of Web services, such as SOAP Web services, expose their own arbitrary sets of operations.
